# Foo - Food & Recipe Assistant

I developed a Food & Recipe Assistant app for iOS using Swift, designed to reduce food waste by allowing users to insert their favorite recipes and ingredients. In addition to its core functionality, the app can let you consum foods based on your recipes when you decide to cook them and refill them when you rebuy them. The custom-built user interface offers a smooth and intuitive experience. All data is securely stored on device, ensuring both speed and enhanced privacy.
